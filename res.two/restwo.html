    <h1>Chana Masala</h1>
    <p>
        Chana Masala, a cherished dish in Indian cuisine, is a tantalizing blend of chickpeas infused with aromatic
        spices. To prepare this flavorful vegetarian delight, onions, tomatoes, and green chilies are sautéed to
        perfection in oil, forming a fragrant base. A harmonious medley of spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric,
        and garam masala, is then introduced, creating a symphony of flavors. The heart of the dish lies in the tender
        chickpeas, either canned or pre-soaked, which simmer in the richly spiced gravy until they absorb the essence of
        the spices. Garnished with fresh coriander leaves, Chana Masala is a protein-packed and wholesome dish that
        pairs splendidly with rice or various Indian breads, offering a culinary journey through the vibrant and diverse
        tapestry of Indian flavors.</p>
